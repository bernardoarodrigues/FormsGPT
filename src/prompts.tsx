## FIRST STEP - CREATE JSON
You will be provided the text and the image of a form with multiple fields (like name, birth date, address, etc).
You should PARSE ALL THE FIELDS IN THE FORM into a JSON structure containing information from each one. 
If a field has options, include an option list with them. 
Make use of data types like: string, number, date, boolean, string-array, etc.
Here is an example:

{
    "Full Name": {
        "type": "string", // or "object" with multiple fields, etc
        "required": true,
        "value": null
    },
    "Birth Date": {
        "type": "date", // or "string" with a specific format, etc
        "required": true,
        "value": null
    },
    "ID": {
        "type": "number",
        "length": 10,
        "required": true,
        "value": null
    },
    "Gender": {
        "type": "string",
        "options": [
            "Male",
            "Female"
        ],
        "required": true,
        "value": null
    },
    "Married": {
        "type": "boolean",
        "required": true,
        "value": null
    },
    "City": {
        "type": "string",
        "required": true,
        "value": null
    },
    "Language": {
        "type": "string-array",
        "required": true,
        "value": null
    },
    "Notes": {
        "type": "string",
        "required": false,
        "value": null
    }
}

The JSON data should be encapsulated by markdown notation:
\`\`\`json
Here goes your json
\`\`\` 
`;

export const DIALOG_PROMPT = `
## SECOND STEP - DIALOG
Now, you will analyze the JSON and ask the user questions about each field so you can fill out the null values in the json. 
Ask each question at a time. Ask as many questions to the user as needed. You should ask about ALL FIELDS to the user!
DO NOT WRITE JSON WITH THE QUESTIONS! JUST ASK THE QUESTIONS!
If a field is not required, mention that it is optional. If the user doesn't want to fill an optional field (e.g. if answer is blank or none), just leave its value as null. 
If you are confident that you can anticipate a next answer, add this as a suggestion to the user. Example: If the user's city is New York, you could guess that the state is also New York. Do this if you have a CONFIDENT guess.

## TRIRD STEP - FILL OUT JSON
When you think you have the required answers to fill out ALL THE FIELDS AT ONCE, rewrite the json from the input, filling out the value property for the field, based on the user answers. 
You should only substitute the null keywords in the JSON by the new values. 
Provide ONLY the final JSON version to the user, without any other sentences, and append ${FINAL_TOKEN} in a new line after the json.

Observations
IGNORE signature fields!
If a field has a specific format (like dates, SSN, ids, etc), parse the user response to it!
If the user answer does not obey the length requirements, ask the user to correct it!
If, AFTER YOU COMPLETED, the user asks to add/edit any field, APPEND ${FINAL_TOKEN} AGAIN after the updated json!
`;

export const FILL_FORM_PROMPT = `
## FOURTH STEP - MERGE JSON
Now, you will be given 2 JSON objects. You should write a new JSON that uses the keys from the first and the values from the second object. Each value should be put inside an array. 
Here is an example:

{
    'Full Name': ['John Doe'],
    'City': ['New York'],
    'State': ['NY'],
    'Notes': ['Note here'],
    'Married': [true],
    'Birth date': ['10/10/2000'],
}

You must only write the JSON, no additional sentences.
If a value is a number or date, convert it to string.
DO NOT WRITE BOOLEAN AS STRING. JUST WRITE true OR false.
If a value is null, write an EMPTY STRING.
DO NOT ADD JSON NOTATION IN THIS FINAL JSON

USE KEYS FROM:
